<h2>p2pmud - Parser Tutorial</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2><p>
p2pmud includes a natural language parser for interpreting the player's
input. This parser supports verbs, nouns, adjectives, prepositional
phrases, and ambiguous words via backtracking.</p><p>
By default, the parser will pretty much handle everything for you
automatically. You don't have to do a lot to customize the parsing if
you don't want to when creating your own adventures.
Many of the most common things you will want to do (like define your
own words) can be done without any coding at all! Well explain more of
this shortly.</p><p>
Most commands are of the two simple forms "verb" and "verb now" For
example, the user can say "look" or "look here" Lots of times verbs can
accept optional nouns or "arguments" to the verb aka "command". If you
use the help command, you can see exactly what the parser is looking
for.</p><p>

<span class="cmd">
Type: help look<br>
</span></p><p>

</p><pre>Usage: look [object]
   object (Thing) - The object is the item you would like to see. This will default to your current location.

Synonyms: spy see examine glance peer study read
</pre>
This tells you that the look verb is expecting one noun, but that it is
optional. It will default to the current room if not defined. If you
create your own commands,
you will supply this information to the parser so it can parse your new
command for you. Also you will see that any verb can have synonyms
defined. The parser knows that "spy" is a synonym for "look" but it
will retain the fact that the user used the word spy and not look. In
the resulting output, the synonym spy will be referenced for you
automatically.<p>

<span class="cmd">
Type: spy me<br>
</span></p><p>

</p><pre>You spy at admin and see: Nothing out of the ordinary. admin looks to be in perfect health! (100%) 
</pre>

<h2>Special words and characters</h2><p>
There are two special words "here" and "me". The parser assigns special
meaning to these two words to be your current room and yourself
respectively. Also, there
are several shortcuts the parser understands. If a line starts with a
quote('), it knows you want to say something outloud, a colon(:), it
will issue a emote command,
for authors an exclamation mark (!)will let you evaluate any Javascript
expression on the fly, and a question mark (?) is a shortcut for help.</p><p>

<span class="cmd">
Type: :scratches his head<br>
Type: "hey this parser is really neat!<br>
Type: !5<br>
Type: ?get<br>
</span></p><p>

</p><h2>Shortcuts</h2><p>
The parser already knows about common abbreviations players like to
use, for example, nw to mean northwest. You won't have to set any of
these up by hand. Also,
all things in the game have a default verb attached to them. If the
user double clicks the image, or just types the name of the object in,
it will assume the user
wanted to take this default action. For Thing objects, the default is
to look, for Exit objects, the default is to travel through it, etc.
You can override this
for a particular object if you like!</p><p>

<span class="cmd">
Type: create apple Food<br>
Type: setprop apple defaultVerb /eat<br>
Type: get apple<br>
Type: apple<br>
</span></p><p>

</p><h2>Learning words</h2><p>
Also, the parser automatically knows all of words used by the name's of
every item in the current room. So if there is a "red ball" in the
current room, you don't
have to teach the parser that "red" is an adjective and "ball" is a
noun, it will infer that automatically!</p><p>
However, sometimes you will want to teach the parser a new word. There
is a command just for this called "bind". You specify the word, the
type that it is,
and optionally another word it references. Make sure you remember to
snapshot your work or else the parser won't remember your new words
once you restart!! Let's say you want to teach the parser a new
Preposition, a new Modifier (adjective) a new Quantifier (numerical
adjective) and a new Synonym.</p><p>

<span class="cmd">
Type: bind within Preposition<br>
Type: bind purple Modifier<br>
Type: bind twelve Quantifier 12<br>
Type: bind bellow Synonym /say<br>
</span></p><p>
The parser now recognizes that 'within' is a preposition, 'purple' is
an adjective, 'twelve' is a numerical adjective, and 'bellow' is the
equivalent of 'say'. Here
you have to preceed say with a forward slash or use quotes around it so
the parser gets the word 'say' and not the verb say. We don't give an
example of making an entirely new verb here,
because you have to actually create a command object for it, and that's
a later tutorial. However, you can now:</p><p>

<span class="cmd">
Type: bellow "you fool!<br>
</span></p><p>
It's actually pretty rare you will have to bind your own Verbs,
Modifiers, or Nouns, since these are done automatically. Usually you'll
just want to make up synonyms for words the parser already knows. If
you want the parser to forget a word you already taught it, there is an
unbind command. This takes a single argument, the word
you want to unbind. Don't forget if it is a verb (or a synonym for one)
you will have to put a leading slash in front of it.</p><p>

<span class="cmd">
Type: unbind within<br>
Type: unbind /bellow<br>
</span></p><p>

</p><h2>Abbreviations and Ambigous words</h2><p>
The parser handles abbreviated words, and ambiguous words for you.  Try the following sequence of commands:</p><p>
<span class="cmd">
Type: create "red ball"<br>
Type: look ba<br>
Type: create "blue ball"<br>
Type: get ba<br>
Do: Click the 'blue ball' link<br>
</span></p><p>
What's going on here? First, we created an item called "red ball". The
object was created with 'red' as an adjective and 'ball' as a noun.
When you said 'look ba'
the parser realized there is only one object in the room that matches
'ba' so you look at it. Now when you created the blue ball and wanted
to get it, the parser saw
that two potential items could match and generated a question back to
the user. You can either type in the answer, or to make it easier, you
can click one of the links
provided by the parser to answer the question. The parser knows that it
posed a question back to the user and if the user answers it, will
continue on with the action!
Now try this:</p><p>

<span class="cmd">
Type: drop ba<br>
</span></p><p>
You should drop the blue ball you are carrying! How come the parser
didn't ask which ball this time? Commands can give contextual hints to
the parser, the Drop
command tells the parser that it prefers objects carried by the user
over objects in the same room as the user. The parser used this
knowledge to automatically
decide that you must have meant to drop the blue ball since you aren't
carrying the red ball! Clever, eh?</p><p>

</p><h2>Autospawns</h2><p>
What's an autospawn you might ask? Well, we always thought it was
annoying that you could be in the middle of a forest and type 'get
leaf' and a
game would come back and say either "What is leaf?" or "I don't see
leaf here!" To remedy this, we created autospawns. These are used to
teach the game/parser
about common objects for a particular room. Everytime a player
references one of these words, and there isn't already one present, it
will create a new object for you automatically!! Try it out!</p><p>

<span class="cmd">
Type: name here "Tropical Jungle"<br>
Type: autospawn plant<br>
Type: autospawn coconut<br>
Type: get coconut<br>
</span></p><p>
