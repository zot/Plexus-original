	guitext "Plus, you're liable to have multiple firewalls on your network and possibly not even be"
	guitext "aware of it!  For example, Windows has a software firewall and if you're using a router"
	guitext "such as Linksys or D-Link it will have one as well.  In order for your friends to be able to"
	guitext "play Plexus with you, you need to open a connection on port 9090 on any active firewalls.

	guitext "direction!   For routers, there is usually a means of configuring it by bringing up a"
	guitext "special webpage at http://192.168.0.1   But you will want to refer to the documentation"
	guitext "that came with your router, or go to the manufacturer's website and refer to their"
